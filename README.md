# resistor_arranger
A simple program written in the Python language can be used to arrange a number of resistors to achieve a desired gauge of resistance.
The algorithm behind it uses the 'decrease and conquer algorithm'. For further information, you can visit [the journal](https://informatika.stei.itb.ac.id/~rinaldi.munir/Stmik/2022-2023/Makalah/Makalah-Stima-2023-(40).pdf).

To use the program, you can simply clone this repository, change the variable at main.py to your desired input, then execute the main.py.
